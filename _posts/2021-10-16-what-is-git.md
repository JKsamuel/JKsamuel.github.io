# What is git?
It's been a little over a year since I officially sutdied programming. In order to solve unknown causes of errors that occur during some assignments, someone's Git Pages often appeared when googling. This is how I found out that I got to know the word git.

* Ref: [Git](https://git-scm.com)

According to the website above, Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and effiency.

The definition I understood is as follows.
Usually, projects are carried out through collaboration, not one person. One project tcontains code from multiple developers, and I understood that Git is a tool to manage which developers modified which code and which source code to update to the next version. 

In briefly, Git is a tool for distributed version control system.

## VCS(Version Control System)
