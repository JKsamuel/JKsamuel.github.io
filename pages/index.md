# Who Am I

I am a student who is attending Mohawk College in Hamilton.
Now, three of the six semesters are coming to an end.

Before I came into Canada with my family, I served over 10years in R.O.K.A. as an Infantry Officer. I have been some international experience regarding working with U.S Army in Korea and UNIFIL in Lebanon. But as I mentioned that I served over 10years in ROKA, and I had felt something stuck in my life. So, I wanted to learn how-to programming and I decided to discharge.

I didn't get discharged to study this. However, it was programming that I thought about what I wanted to learn new in the process of preparing for my second life. I started to be interested in programming when I started dealing with MS Excel. I don't know many functions, but the output when I used the functions provided by Excel to shorten my working hours and use the functions was so amazing. What made me think about making a new one was the opportunity to choose this path.

I thought I would simply do Excel, but I didn't know any other programming languages.

It's fun to learn new things one by one.
Even if it takes time, it's fun to solve the problem step by step.

I'll look for and research to see if there's anything fun going on.
We're going to make something fun.
